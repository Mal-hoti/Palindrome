# Palindrome

To check if a word such as RACECAR is a palindrome, what I do is check the first word letter and last letter. If they are the same then I move on to the second and second to last letter and check if they are the same. So for RACECAR ( as its an odd length the middle one is E)

 R  R  o
 A  A  o
 C  C  o
 E     o
 
 this is a palindrom

for DEFIED 
 
 D  D o
 E  E o
 F  I x 
 Wrong. this is not a palindrome
 
 This is how I check in my head if this is how a word or even a number is a palindrome
